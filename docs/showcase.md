    Ancient Greeks celebrated their gods with lively processions. We have a ton of archaeological and textual data to learn from, but it's difficult to imagine all of the different smells, tastes, sights, noises, and textures. This essay uses a modern religious festival in Massachusetts to explain why ancient processions were such spectacles. We discover that ancient Greek processional participants and spectators came together to shape this sensory experience.

    Games and gambling have mystical origins rooted in early cultures' attempts to predict the future, to appeal to the gods, and to discover hidden aspects of reality. Fortune tellers threw knucklebones, shot arrows, and dealt cards as a way to uncover the hidden forces shaping our lives. The modern components of board games evolved from these early practices and artifacts.
