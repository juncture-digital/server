# Juncture Media Tool

The Juncture Media Tool is used to view and manage media content hosted in Github.  This is typically used for managing a personal collection of media for use in an essay.  The media tool defaults to a repository named `media` in a users personal Github account.  Any repository may be used to store media files but aggregating them into a single repository (such as `media`) will make if more convenient to browse and manage the content.
